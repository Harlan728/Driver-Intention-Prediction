# Driver-Intention-Prediction
A framework predicts driver's maneuver behaviors.

Pytorch implementation of the paper ["Driver Intention Anticipation Based on In-Cabin and Driving Scene Monitoring"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11557.pdf).

Here is the demo of our framework:

In this demo, the prediction is made after every second. If the prediction is correct, there is a âœ“. 


## Dataset Preparation

The dataset used is downloaded from [Brain4cars](https://github.com/asheshjain399/ICCV2015_Brain4Cars).

Videos are extracted into images with the fps=25 under each directory. 

We split the dataset using 5-fold cross validaton. Run script ``n_fold_Brain4cars.py`` in directory ``datasets/annotation`` to split.

(Or you can use the five ``.csv`` files in ``datasets/annotation`` .)


## Train 3D-ResNet50 with driver videos


The network, 3D-ResNet 50 and its pretrained model is downloaded from [3D ResNets](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch). 

We thank this project :)


Before running the run-3DResnet.sh script. Please give the path to: 
1. ``root_path``: path to this project.

2. ``annotation_path`` : path to annotation directory in this project.

3. ``video_path``: path to image frames of driver videos.

4. ``pretrain_path``: path to the pretrained 3D ResNet 50 model.


**Notes**:

1. ``n_fold``: is the number of the fold. Here, n_fold is from 0 to 4.

2. ``sample_duration``: the length of input vidoes. Here, 16 frames.

3. ``end_second``: the second before the maneuver. Here, end_second is from 1 to 5.

   E.g. end_second = 3, frames which are 3 seconds (including the third second) before maneuver are given as input.

More details about other args, please refer to the ``opt.py``.
