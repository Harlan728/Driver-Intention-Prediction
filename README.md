# Driver-Intention-Prediction
A framework predicts driver's maneuver behaviors.

Pytorch implementation of the paper ["Driver Intention Anticipation Based on In-Cabin and Driving Scene Monitoring"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11557.pdf).

Here is the demo of our framework:

In this demo, the prediction is made after every second. If the prediction is correct, there is a âœ“. 

*Code will be uploaded soon*
